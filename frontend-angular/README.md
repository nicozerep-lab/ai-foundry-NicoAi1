# Angular Frontend (Placeholder)

This directory is a placeholder for an Angular frontend application.

## Planned Features

- Angular 17+ with TypeScript
- Angular Material UI components
- Real-time communication with backends
- Dashboard interface similar to React version
- Azure AI integration
- GitHub integration

## Getting Started

This is currently a placeholder. To set up an Angular application:

```bash
npx -p @angular/cli ng new frontend-angular --routing --style=scss
cd frontend-angular
npm install @angular/material @angular/cdk socket.io-client
```

## Development

```bash
npm start
# or
ng serve
```

## Docker

A Dockerfile will be added when the Angular application is implemented.

## Status

ðŸš§ **Placeholder - Not Implemented**

This directory is reserved for future Angular frontend development. The CI/CD pipeline will detect and skip this service until it's properly implemented.
